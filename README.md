# xscript2data
A Python script for Blender 3D which imports data from an XML file into the scene.

I have been editing this script for over 10 years and it is a mess, but I thought I'd include it here in case someone finds it useful. I need to document this program.

The first thing that must be done is to edit the xscript_libraries.txt file to include the file names and paths to the .blend files to be used with this program.
Then line 1604 must be edited to include the path and file name of the xscript_libraries.txt file.
